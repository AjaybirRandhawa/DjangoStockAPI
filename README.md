# DjangoStockAPI
  Used Django framework with html templates to build a Stock API which uses ticker symbols to find latest stock information. Django is most often used for projects that involve dynamic pages, rather than static pages. 
# Libraries
  Used yfinance, urllib and a few more to make a customized dynamic page.
# Featuers
  Features are very basic as of now with simple assertion and deletion. The page is structured to represent the data in an aesthetically appealing format.
